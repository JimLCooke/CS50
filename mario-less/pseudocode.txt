    Ask the user how tall they want the pyramid to be; user input.
    Keep asking until they give a number between 1 and 8.
    Make a loop to build one row of the pyramid at a time.
    Inside the loop, make another loop to print the spaces at the start of each row.
    Inside the loop, make another loop to print the hashes for each row.
    After each row, go to the next line.
    When the loop is done, stop.
