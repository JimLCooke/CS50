This pseudocode outlines the steps for checking the command-line arguments, prompting the user for a plaintext message, and encrypting the message using the Caesar cipher. It also handles errors that may occur if the user does not provide a valid key.

Check if the user provided a single command-line argument (key)
    If not, print an error message and exit

Convert the key to an integer
    If the key is not a valid number, print an error message and exit

Prompt the user for a plaintext message

Encrypt the message using the Caesar cipher
    For each character in the plaintext message
        If the character is a letter
            Shift the letter by the key value
        Print the character

Print a newline character and exit
