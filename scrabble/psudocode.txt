Create a constant array called POINTS that stores the point values for each letter of the alphabet

Define a function called compute_score that takes a string as input and returns an integer
    Initialize a variable called score to 0
    For each character in the string
        If the character is a letter
            Convert the character to lowercase
            Add the point value of the character to the score
        Otherwise, do nothing
    Return the score

Define the main function
    Prompt the first player for their word and store it in a variable called word1
    Prompt the second player for their word and store it in a variable called word2
    Call the compute_score function with word1 as the argument and store the result in a variable called score1
    Call the compute_score function with word2 as the argument and store the result in a variable called score2
    If score1 is greater than score2
        Print "Player 1 wins!"
    Else if score2 is greater than score1
        Print "Player 2 wins!"
    Otherwise
        Print "Tie!"
    End
